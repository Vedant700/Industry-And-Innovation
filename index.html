            The story of industrial development has been an important determinant of the course of our history as a
            community of nations. From the first steam engines to the first assembly lines, to today’s truly global
            production chains and processes, industry has changed our economies and helped drive major changes in our
            societies. But without sustainable practices and infrastructure in place, our growth has left vast sections

                AI and machine learning are driving innovations across industries and functional areas. AI-specific
                hardware and new algorithms are being developed to optimize the existing systems and tackle new
                challenges facing manufacturing. Factories are beginning to integrate AI across their production systems
                and processes. Advanced AI makes it possible to conduct predictive maintenance, cognitive computing,
                swarm intelligence, context-aware computing, smart machines, hardware accelerators, and generative
                design. All of these technologies propel manufacturing facilities to move towards complete lights-out

                Advancements in robotics make the processes in industry 4.0 faster, efficient, and safer. The most
                prominent robotic technologies impacting manufacturing include autonomous robots, collaborative robots
                (cobots), collaborative autonomous mobile robots, humanoid, mobile robots, cloud robotics, APIs, pick
                and place robots, and robot swarms. The use of robots offers higher precision and agility while
                improving the capability of rapidly developing customizable robots. Robots also free up time for the
                human workforce to focus on other non-repetitive or high-value tasks.
                <br>
                Typical applications of robots include welding, painting, assembly, disassembly, pick and place for
                printed circuit boards, packaging and labeling, palletizing, product inspection, and testing

                Manufacturers constantly search for new technologies to cater to all aspects of the growing market
                demand. Additive manufacturing, which started out as a prototyping technique, is revolutionizing and
                decentralizing production. Hybrid manufacturing aims to integrate both additive manufacturing and
                subtractive manufacturing. The advancement in material science and techniques such as stereolithography
                and metal 3D printing enables a simple fabrication of intricate structures and complex components.
                Additive manufacturing is making highly-customizable and sustainable cloud-based production a reality.

                The physical and cognitive augmentation of humans forms another major industry 4.0 trend. The
                limitations in humans are being augmented with the help of technologies such as wearables and
                exoskeletons. Further, industrial mobile devices, natural and intuitive UI, and portable machine control
                screens enhance the ease of using such technology. XR technologies like mixed reality (MR), augmented
                reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR) are already in use in Industry 4.0 from the research and
                development (R&D) to full-scale production and post-production processes. This multi-experience paradigm
                is changing the way industrial manufacturing systems function. The nature of human-machine interaction
                is aligning more toward machine-enabled workers.

                Network and connectivity are among the main driving forces in enabling Industry 4.0. A number of
                technology developments such as edge-to-cloud, gigabit ethernet time-sensitive networks, low-power
                wide-area network (LPWAN), 5G, machine-to-machine communication (M2M), real-time deterministic ethernet,
                time-sensitive networking (TSN), ubiquitous radio access, unified IoT framework, and zero-touch networks
                nudge factories to implement IIoT to transform into Industry 4.0 facilities. These technologies
                constantly improve machine-machine and human-machine communication, as well as data transmission. As a
                result, innovations in this area increase speed, improve security and efficiency, and reduce the cost of
                network connectivity.
